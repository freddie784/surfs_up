# W. Avy's Icecream Surf Shop

## Overview of analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to gather the temperatures of both the months of June and December between 2010 to 2017 on the Island of Oahu. After gathering the information we did a statistical analysis on the data to gather trends and decide whether to build the icecream surf-shop or not

## Results
Below are three key differences that were found between the month of June and December in our analysis.

- The average temperature in June was higher than December. However, both averages were in the 70s

- The standard deviation for the temperatures in December was greater than June, signifying that temperatures were more volatile in December.

- 50% of the temperatures in December were below 71ºF, while, 25% of Junes temperatures were below 73ºF.


## Summary
Below are the tables that are being referred to throughout the summary.

**December**
            

 Oahu has pretty consistent temperatures considering the two months that are on opposite seasons have means with a 5 degree difference. With a greater standard deviation in December compared to June there is a high probability that there is more rain in that month as well. My theory is proven in another Query that looks at the precipitation data for the months of June and December.

***December***

Lastly, Water temperatures below 70 degrees Fahrenheit is considered too cold to swim in and looking at the quartile data almost 50 percent of the dates in December would be close to or below that threshold. A second query that could be done giving us more confidence and accuracy would be to get data from a station or stations that are closer to our planned store location. Below are the temperature statistics from the station closest to the future store location and it is not looking like December will be a favorable month for business.
